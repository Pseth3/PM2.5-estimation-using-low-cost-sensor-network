PM2.5 prediction using popular ML algorithms
Fine particulate matter or, PM2·5 was estimated to have caused 8·42 million deaths in 2016[1]
Lack of monitors due to high cost of PM2·5 monitors
Emerging low cost sensor network and addressing the low accuracy challenge
EPA’s AirNow portal utilize linear regression[2] method on low cost sensor data to estimate PM2.5 
Our project uses machine learning models to estimate PM2.5 with a higher accuracy compared to the legacy model
